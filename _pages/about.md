title: About Me
subtitle: Hello! My name is Hannah Fogarty. I'm a Charlottesville-based museum professional and curriculum designer breaking into the design world. My love of all things visual is the constant thread in my life.

My experience is in 2-dimensional design for the museum, with more recent forays into logo design, advertising, and digital drawing. UI is on my horizon.
