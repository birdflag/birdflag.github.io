<small> Hello! My name is Hannah Fogarty. I'm a Charlottesville-based graphic designer. Tarheel (B.A.) and Ram (M.A.), with deep roots in art and design history.
<br>
<br>
I love working with entrepreneurs, hard workers, and dreamers who are putting something new out into the world, and I can help you find the right visual presence for your endeavor. No time to hire a graphic designer and copywriter? I offer copywriting for your business to both show and tell the world what you're all about.  

<small> Contact me at hfogartydesign@gmail.com to talk, or use the Design Form to share your vision!
