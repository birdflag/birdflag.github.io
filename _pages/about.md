description: About the designer
---

<small> My name is Hannah Fogarty. I'm a graphic designer in Charlottesville, VA.

<small> I love working with hard workers and dreamers who are putting something new out into the world, and I can help you find the right visual presence. I create handmade designs that solve the problem of how to communicate who you are and what you offer.
