<small style="line-height:1.2">My name is Hannah Fogarty. I'm a graphic designer in Charlottesville, VA.</small>

<small style="line-height:1.2">I love working with folks who are putting something new out into the world, and I can help you find the right visual presence for your endeavor. I create handmade designs that solve the problem of how to communicate who you are and what you offer.</small>
