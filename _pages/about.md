Hello! My name is Hannah Fogarty. I'm a Charlottesville-based graphic designer, museum professional, and curriculum developer. My love of all things visual is the constant thread in my life.
<br>
<br>
My experience is in 2-dimensional design for the museum, with more recent forays into logo design, advertising, and digital drawing. Contact me using the link on the left to talk project ideas!
