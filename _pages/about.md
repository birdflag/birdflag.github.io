Hello! My name is Hannah Fogarty. I'm a Charlottesville-based graphic designer, museum professional, and art teacher. My love of all things visual is the constant thread in my life.
<br>
<br>
My experience is in branding and publicity, with more recent forays into illustration. Contact me at hfogartydesign@gmail.com to talk project ideas!
