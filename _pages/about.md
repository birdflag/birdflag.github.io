Hello! My name is Hannah Fogarty. I'm a Charlottesville-based graphic designer and art teacher. My love of all things visual is the constant thread in my life. 
<br>
<br>
My experience is in branding and publicity; packaging design; patterns and repeats; and illustration. I can help you find the right visual presence for your endeavor.
