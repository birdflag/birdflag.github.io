#### <i> Speculative redesign of a brand I love and use daily, Charlottesville's own Shenandoah Joe Coffee Roasters. </i>

### The Project

My redesign keeps the original colors and sporty varsity font (this is in University territory, after all) while incorporating the peaks of the Shenandoah mountains. This brand's name, and its Virginia location surrounded by beautiful blue hills, makes this redesign mesh smoothly with its identity.
