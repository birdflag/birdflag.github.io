#### <i> Brand identity for a fictional coffee roasting brand. Did I mention I love coffee? I used this imagined company to come up with an original logo and practice building elements and a mockup for their website. </i>

### The Project

Cerise, as you may know, is the French word for cherry. Like most millenials, I go crazy for fruity coffee that has been processed to keep the coffee cherry flavors. This fictional brand uses warm colors and botanical forms to suggest the plant coffee comes from, and the fruit flavors its imagined roasts carry.

I'm beginning my journey in the land of UI; mockups are not yet functional prototypes. Mockup images courtesy of rawpixel.com, except for woman with coffee cup, courtesy of freepik.com.
