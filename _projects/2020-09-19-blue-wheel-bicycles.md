#### <i> Speculative brand redesign for our local bike shop, a local institution with 40 years under its belt. </i>

### The Project
This design maintains the shop's clean brand identity, it's use of blue &#40;duh&#41;, while creating sleeker forms and a more legible name. I chose a font that conveys forward motion without being too tech-y or too pretentious.
